Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project presents a Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel.
The dashboard provides an interactive view of patient admission, demographics, wait times, satisfaction, and referral patterns.
It helps hospital administrators and decision-makers monitor patient flow, staff performance, and service utilization.

ðŸ—‚ Data Source
The dataset contains emergency room records, including:
Patient demographics (age, gender, race)

ðŸ”„ Data Cleaning & Transformation
The dataset was cleaned and transformed before creating the dashboard:
Removed duplicate entries
Handled missing values (e.g., "Declined to Identify" in patient race)
Standardized categorical fields (e.g., Male/Female)
Converted age into age groups (0-9, 20-29, etc.)
Created new calculated fields such as:
    % Admission Status
    Patient Attend Status (Delay vs. Ontime)
